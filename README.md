First off there are no canceled campaigns in the plays criteria.
Campaigns with a fundraising goal of less than 1000 and from 1000 to 4999 were most successful with 76% and 73% respectively.
Fundraising goal target of 45000 to 49999 failed tremendously with 0% rate and should be avoided at all cost.

45000 to 49999 fundraising goal must be avoided at all cost.

Goals outcomes must be below 4999 if Louise wants to succeed.
